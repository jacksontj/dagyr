# TODO
    - what to do with invalid return type (how to handle the error)-- abort DAG?
    - better conversion/visualization/editor tools?
        -- convert DAG to embedded view (for reading)
        -- convert DAG to image (with labels etc.)
    - processing_nodes:
        - calling other processing_nodes, this will be useful for
            iterating (to avoid the need for loops) and wrapping execution to happen
            remotely or at a later time
        - pass pointer of "DagExecutor" to DagExecutionContext (or APIs to access path information)
