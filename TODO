# TODO
    - what to do with invalid return type (how to handle the error)-- abort DAG?
    - better conversion/visualization/editor tools?
        -- convert DAG to embedded view (for reading)
        -- convert DAG to image (with labels etc.)
    - support processing_nodes returning futures (some non-blocking task)
    - Callback API in DAGExecutor to call with state after every dag/step?
        - thinking of the autoremediation case-- some of these steps may take a LONG
            time to complete (hours+), so the state might want to be persisted


    - Config
        -- name and info are the same 99% of the time, we should probably make
            info optional and default to "name"
