# TODO
    - listen options (certs, ports, etc.) -- setup DAG, run once per config load
    - what to do with invalid return type (how to handle the error)-- abort DAG?
    - comments on nodes
    - validate DAG on config load
        -- warning log message for nodes we don't link?
    - better conversion/visualization/editor tools?
        -- convert DAG to embedded view (for reading)
        -- convert DAG to image (with labels etc.)

# Problems/Questions
    - what options_data should be exposed when executing DAGs like 'dynamic_domain_localhost:8888'
        should we just have the option data be associated with the hook? or layer it?

# refactor TODO
    - change "execution_context" to "hook_dag_map" and move the "options_data"
        to the DAG we specifically want each dag to have a concrete
        "options_data", so that when you hit the same node it always has the
        same args etc.

        TLDR; we want this for "case consistency"
